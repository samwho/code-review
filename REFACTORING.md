# Code Review Tool - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to improve code readability and maintainability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modular Architecture
- **Before**: Large monolithic files with mixed responsibilities
- **After**: Separated concerns into focused modules

#### New Structure:
```
src/
├── types/           # Type definitions
│   ├── analysis.ts  # Code analysis types
│   └── git.ts       # Git operation types
├── analyzers/       # Code analysis modules
│   ├── import-parser.ts
│   ├── export-parser.ts
│   ├── function-parser.ts
│   └── symbol-extractor.ts
├── parsers/         # Data parsing modules
│   └── diff-parser.ts
└── utils/           # Utility functions
```

### 2. Type Safety
- Extracted all interfaces into dedicated type files
- Added type guards for runtime validation
- Improved type annotations throughout

### 3. Single Responsibility Principle
- `DependencyAnalyzer` now delegates to specialized parsers
- `GitService` uses `DiffParser` for parsing git output
- Each analyzer handles one specific aspect of code analysis

### 4. Improved Readability
- Smaller, focused functions (most under 20 lines)
- Descriptive method and variable names
- Clear separation of concerns
- Added JSDoc comments for public APIs

### 5. Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in `executeGitCommand`
- Better error messages with context
- Graceful fallbacks for dependency analysis

## Benefits

1. **Easier to understand**: New developers can quickly grasp what each module does
2. **Easier to test**: Each module can be tested in isolation
3. **Easier to extend**: Adding new features doesn't require modifying large files
4. **Better performance**: Modular structure enables better tree-shaking
5. **Type safety**: Stronger typing catches errors at compile time

## Next Steps

To further improve the codebase:
1. Add unit tests for each module
2. Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
3. Consider adding a linter (ESLint) for consistent code style
4. Add error boundaries in the frontend code
5. Consider extracting the frontend into a modern framework
